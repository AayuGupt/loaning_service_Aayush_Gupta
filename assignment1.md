The code is written in python. The code can be runned in any of the python compilers.
I had converted the integer to string and added with given string so to get a new string as required in question. 
Then I converted string to hash code and converted to upper case. 
Then compared with given string. Then I converted j back to integer and added 1 to get new j. 
I also calculated runtime using time library.


Sample cases- 
1) input- abcd
output- The nonce value is 1389020
Total runtime of the program is 3.710726499557495 seconds.

2) input- iitk
output:
The nonce value is 1217060
Total runtime of the program is 3.771918535232544 seconds.
