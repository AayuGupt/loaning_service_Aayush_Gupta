The code is written in python. The code can be runned in any of the python compilers.
I have declared two classes, one for lender and other for borrower.
I have converted the serial number as variable and then used this variable to declare an object
Then I have input the data from the user.
Different lenders can charge different rate of interest.
And then printed the full details after calculating date of repayment and money to pay back after calculating compound interest.

# Question asked in Recruitment Task
#Q: Is the loaning system that you implemented centralized or decentralized? Point out the demerit(s) of a centralized system.
#Ans: I have implemented de-centralized loaning system. Decentralized system allows people to engage in trade directly with each other. Each borrower can enter the details of the lender. There is no centralized system like that of bank where lenders give money to bank and borrowers take money from bank. Any borrower can directly take money from the lender.

Demerits of centralized banking system:
Centralized banking system are usually slower than decentralized system which deals with inappropriate and delay customer services. There is slow decision making and it depends on many people. Meanwhile, in decentralized banking system the customer or the borrower can directly interact with the lender. In centralized system the interest is chared higher as the central body is also involved in th e loan process. While in Decentralized borrower take money directly from lender.
